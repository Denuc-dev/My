In this project he implemented physics in the console, with all its branches, namely jumping, climbing a ladder, running to the right and left. Also did not do without items, there are quite a lot (for playing in the console)
# - Earth
* - Stairs
- - Finish
'- Death zone
+ - Checkpoint
= - Ladder
~ - Trampoline
Please don't take the game seriously, it's just my game where I was too lazy to do it so there's a lot of bad code.
